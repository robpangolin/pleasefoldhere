      <p>This is intended as a place to talk about the things that interest me at any given moment. It will be a random assortment of blog posts, videos, and general thoughts. There will be two types of post here. The daily vids, uploaded daily (obviously) with one video from the day that I found particularly interesting. And the weekly update, posted on a Sunday, discussing what's been happening in my head over the last week or so, ranging from ethics, politics, working life etc.</p>

I imagined this ritual exercise for her, a short daily excursion into a loud, uncertain, and increasingly unfamiliar world. I imagined eons of sedimented truth built up over a lifetime on planet Earth gradually eroding away, layer by layer, into obscurity. Her whole life spent trying to understand a world that was perpetually new and ever changing. Battling against the tides of society's changes. From post-war solidarity, to the rise of the individual and myth of self determined success. To the entrenchment of global systems that brought the unimaginable reach of rhe world to her doorstep. She rolled with the punches. New people, new views, new buildings, new cars, new food, new drinks, everything different from shopping bags to wallpaper to money to sport to clothes. Until something finally tripped her. Perhaps it was the Internet, email, social media, or electric scooters. At some point time outran her. She began not to recognise the people of her home town. How they behaved. The threats to her world no single person or nation, but a clouded mix of a million things nobody had yet been able to explain to her properly. Her world gradually narrowed to 200 metres of pavement. But then she looked up. She smiled at me proudly. It was a look I remembered from long ago. I had it the first time I ran to the top of that hill in Bath. And I couldn't help but smile back."

              "text":"Running is a pretty popular pastime. It’s a quick form of exercise. Most able-bodied people can do it, and it’s the primary building block of most major sports. Because anyone can do it, and everyone has some idea of what distances mean, the basic concept is easily communicable and well understood. Someone will know what you mean when you say you’ve run 20 miles – that you’ve recently travelled a distance that no-doubt caused you a lot of pain. Because running, for all its great accessibility is hard. That’s kind of the point. It pushes your body into a state of emergency where its suddenly trying to garner energy much faster than it’s normally used to. Your body releases painkillers just to help you through this turmoil, and injects adrenaline to push you beyond your usual physical comfort zone. All your mind can think about is when you plan to stop, thrusting everything else to one side. As a reward you get a clear mind and a pain relief high for a few hours after. You get a sense of freedom and refreshment. You feel oxygenated and satisfied. But one of the best things about running is how quickly the gains from one run can pass on to the next. When you run you do battle with three bodily systems. One, most obvious, is the muscular system in your legs. This has an inherent resilience which if exceeded will see them start to slow and eventually fail. However, this system seldom fails before your second system, your cardiovascular system. This is the ability you have to keep oxygen flowing to your muscles at a sufficiently high rate. You notice this system failing pretty early if you haven’t run for a while. Your heart beats uncomfortably fast and your breathing rises out of control; at worst you wheeze and hold your knees, or get a bad stitch from all the anaerobic work your muscles are having to do to keep up with the lack of oxygen. But your cardiovascular system is unlikely to be the first system to fail. Far more likely is that your mind, the final system, will let you down first. Training for a long run is as much about building a positive belief in yourself as it is about improving your cardio and strengthening your legs. It’s about gradually persuading yourself that you are able; that “you are worthy” of the task ahead of you. If you’re doing a long run and all your body is telling you is “stop, for god’s sake!” that’s absolutely normal. But if you can hear yourself screaming stop and decide instead to keep going, that’s true strength. And that’s what spills over into normal life when you finish it."
