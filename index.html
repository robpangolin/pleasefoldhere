      <p>This is intended as a place to talk about the things that interest me at any given moment. It will be a random assortment of blog posts, videos, and general thoughts. There will be two types of post here. The daily vids, uploaded daily (obviously) with one video from the day that I found particularly interesting. And the weekly update, posted on a Sunday, discussing what's been happening in my head over the last week or so, ranging from ethics, politics, working life etc.</p>

              "text":"Running is a pretty popular pastime. It’s a quick form of exercise. Most able-bodied people can do it, and it’s the primary building block of most major sports. Because anyone can do it, and everyone has some idea of what distances mean, the basic concept is easily communicable and well understood. Someone will know what you mean when you say you’ve run 20 miles – that you’ve recently travelled a distance that no-doubt caused you a lot of pain. Because running, for all its great accessibility is hard. That’s kind of the point. It pushes your body into a state of emergency where its suddenly trying to garner energy much faster than it’s normally used to. Your body releases painkillers just to help you through this turmoil, and injects adrenaline to push you beyond your usual physical comfort zone. All your mind can think about is when you plan to stop, thrusting everything else to one side. As a reward you get a clear mind and a pain relief high for a few hours after. You get a sense of freedom and refreshment. You feel oxygenated and satisfied. But one of the best things about running is how quickly the gains from one run can pass on to the next. When you run you do battle with three bodily systems. One, most obvious, is the muscular system in your legs. This has an inherent resilience which if exceeded will see them start to slow and eventually fail. However, this system seldom fails before your second system, your cardiovascular system. This is the ability you have to keep oxygen flowing to your muscles at a sufficiently high rate. You notice this system failing pretty early if you haven’t run for a while. Your heart beats uncomfortably fast and your breathing rises out of control; at worst you wheeze and hold your knees, or get a bad stitch from all the anaerobic work your muscles are having to do to keep up with the lack of oxygen. But your cardiovascular system is unlikely to be the first system to fail. Far more likely is that your mind, the final system, will let you down first. Training for a long run is as much about building a positive belief in yourself as it is about improving your cardio and strengthening your legs. It’s about gradually persuading yourself that you are able; that “you are worthy” of the task ahead of you. If you’re doing a long run and all your body is telling you is “stop, for god’s sake!” that’s absolutely normal. But if you can hear yourself screaming stop and decide instead to keep going, that’s true strength. And that’s what spills over into normal life when you finish it."
